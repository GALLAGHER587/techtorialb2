# Create a string vaarible 

a = "hello" #12345


b = "hello " # 123456

# How do we compare these two strings?

# We can use == sign to compare two string values 


print(a == b) #False 


c = "Hello"

print(a == c) # False because the cases of the string are important 

print (a == "hello") # True 

print('hello'== "hello") # True 

# String is one of the built in data types in python 
# And string valules are immutable, they dont change their values unless reassigned
